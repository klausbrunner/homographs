homographs
==========

This is a crude Java applet for finding homographs (homoglyphs, confusables) of Latin-1 characters in the Unicode BMP, as used in various attacks.

Results depend heavily on your installed fonts â€“ most fonts have glyphs only for a small subset of Unicode. Windows users should try e.g. Arial, Georgia or Verdana. Symbol fonts tend to produce useless results.

This project is no longer under development, it's placed here for archival purposes.
